## 📌 Goal
To analyze what drives engagement (likes + comments + shares) on social media posts, and test simple models for predicting engagement.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
1. ✅ **Videos and polls win**  
   Video posts had the strongest positive impact on engagement, followed by polls. Text and image posts reduced engagement compared to the baseline.

2. 📱 **Instagram leads the way**  
   Instagram posts generated the highest average engagement — more than Facebook or Twitter.

3. 🌙 **Night-time posts perform best**  
   Posts shared between 11pm and 5am received the most engagement on average.

4. 📈 **Model results**  
   Tested 3 models — Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
   Surprisingly, **Linear Regression performed best** (likely due to small dataset and clear patterns).
